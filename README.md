# Mood Tracker with AI Insights

## Overview

The **Mood Tracker with AI Insights** is a mobile application built with **React Native**, which allows users to track their mood on a scale of 1-5 along with a brief description of how they are feeling.

The app includes a **simple UI** where users can input their mood, describe their feelings, and get real-time feedback from the AI.
